# Windows Malware Portable Executable

Note: This was the README.md that was in the repository when I entered Github Classroom and I decided not to eliminate it. 

The original page for the dataset can be found here: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/windows-malwares).

## Dataset

A dataset for Windows Portable Executable Samples with two feature sets. It contains two CSV files, one CSV file per feature set. The original dataset contains four feature sets.

- First feature set (DLLs_Imported.csv file) contains the DLLs imported by each malware family. The first column contains SHA256 values, second column contains the label or family type of the malware while the remaining columns list the names of imported DLLs.

- Second feature set (API_Functions.csv files) contains the API functions called by these malware alongwith their SHA256 hash values and labels. 

## Malware Classes (Type field):
- 0 -> Benign
- 1 -> RedLineStealer
- 2 -> Downloader
- 3 -> RAT
- 4 -> BankingTrojan
- 5 -> SnakeKeyLogger
- 6 -> Spyware

## Project 

**Note:** O projeto não está completo devido a falta de tempo (trabalhadora-estudante) e vou melhorar na época de Recurso.

This report presents a comprehensive solution for detecting and analyzing potential prompt injection attacks in AI language model interactions. The system employs a dual-classifier approach, combining traditional machine learning (Random Forest) with modern transformer-based models (DistilBERT) to provide robust detection capabilities. Our implementation includes detailed feature extraction, pattern analysis, and risk assessment components, offering both high accuracy and interpretability in identifying malicious prompts.

## Examples 

1. Text-Based Hiding:

- Unicode manipulation (using look-alike characters)
- Whitespace manipulation (zero-width spaces)
- Text segmentation (splitting malicious commands)
- Base64 or other encodings
- HTML entity encoding

2. Context Manipulation:

Embedding commands in seemingly innocent text
Multi-step attacks that build context gradually
Role-playing scenarios that attempt to change AI behavior

##### Normal looking prompt
"What's the weather like?"

##### Hidden injection using unicode
"What's the weather like？" # Uses a different question mark character
"What's the weather\u200B like" # Zero-width space
"Wh\u0061t's the weather" # Unicode encoding

##### Split injection
"Tell me" + " ignore previous instructions" + " about weather"
